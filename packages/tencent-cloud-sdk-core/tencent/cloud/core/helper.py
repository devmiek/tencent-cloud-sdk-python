import asyncio

def run_with_asyncio(
    coroutine: asyncio.Future
):
    '''
    Create a new event loop and call the given coroutine. The caller will be
    blocked until the coroutine completes.

    In general, run_with_asyncio is used instead of asyncio.run to avoid
    compatibility issues. The caller should only call at the entry point.

    The event loop created will be set as the global default event loop and
    will not be closed until the process terminates.

    Args:
        coroutine: Coroutine that need to be called on the event loop.

    Raises:
        ValueError: The given coroutine is invalid.
